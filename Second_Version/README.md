### Python Challenge 1 Assignment 1

The following assignment I am sumbitting is the first python challenge (assingment 2) for the OSU AI Bootcamp. 

Inside the python file is my code for this assignment, followed along with comments explaining each step/line of code. The code will walk you through a customer's order experience at a fast food truck. 

The following links below are the sources I referenced to provide me a foundation to help me write my python code for this assingment.
